#arp
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol that associates the IP address with the MAC address of a network device. A static ARP entry is a permanent entry in your ARP cache. For example, it might be necessary to add static ARP entries for routers connected to an Active/Active FireCluster.
