*Important Note:*
1. Don't mention semester number as subjects and curriculum will alter with time.
2. I am limited by GitHub's limit of content upload and hence, will take much longer time to upload all data. Needs your valuable contribution.
3. If you don't know the name of a faulty, mark it as 'New Folder (number)' as appropriate.

Keep Contributing (ಠ‿ಠ) (◠﹏◠)
